What is AttackAlert?

AttackAlert is a comprehensive Discord bot designed specifically for Clash of Clans communities. Built with multi-server support and enterprise-grade reliability, it provides automated war monitoring, intelligent reminder systems, and seamless account management across multiple Discord servers.
